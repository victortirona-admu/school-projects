"@MonarchFisher Why?
Because the toxic masculinity culture perpetuates the idea of the white knight saving the damsel to have her ""repay"" the act with sex. Or marriage if it is G rated.

It's also the root of ""nice guy"" and ""friend zone"" bull shit.

That being said, good on ya for doing right."

"Remember, real love always gives. You want a world without war? Great! Now we all have to work for it to happen. Christians, Jews, Muslims, atheists, too. We have to uproot toxic masculinity. It's hard work but we can make it happen, so that we don't have any more tragedies."
@xokeli @LidoDaddy @Rayon_Jarvis @misandryislit @sleazyfairytale He released a song. He can't take the song down... and if A straight male celebrity say that Gay men weren't allowed to speak on them because they didn't like it. It would be considered toxic masculinity and homophobia.

"@SAMN0SE @Tink_spn @HighwayHangover @giddyupdean While stereotyping is a huge problem in fandom, not all instances are stereotyping &amp; yes, it can be a kink. Queer men can be into it too. It can be an issue AND people can have a kink. The two are not mutually exclusive. It's toxic masculinity to say bottoms CAN'T be feminine."
"Aannames over motief kunnen en moeten we niet doen, maar gezien het feit dat deze man seksueel geweldpleger is lijkt het me niet onlogisch om íétsje minder aandacht aan het op niets gebaseerde terrorisme-frame te geven en eens te kijken naar, ik noem maar wat, toxic masculinity. https://t.co/qjfJgB2L9X"
"In other words, it was, in the tradition of old school advertising, manipulation. Gillette knew—because the data told them—people care about toxic masculinity. How convenient for them, as they're in the masculinity business! They decide to take it head on and failed. Why?"
A clear &amp; accurate article by @SophieRunning https://t.co/Pu3uwVao25 I make these points often and whilst I receive some pushback from defensive men this pales into significance when you compare it to the abuse Sophie received.  This is a narrative that many still won’t adopt 1/4

@iBamBamBigalow @AjaTheAuthor @Chaantellie Almost nothing? Really? He made a song about it... clearly she didn’t like he and then he went on live talking about her having a pussy and penetration. That’s TOO much. And that’s not how toxic masculinity works. Shawty said it was weird... so let it go.

"It's the same with men, as well, but in a negative sense rather than a dismissive sense. Toxic masculinity is viciously homophobic, boys learn very young that any kind of affection towards another boy is scornful. The term ""Bromance"" is a direct result of these attitudes. [6/8]"

"Sexual harassment is not okay. Justifying violence from a known abuser is not okay. Instead of pushing the issue due to rejection and ignoring accountability, consent, toxic masculinity, sexuality, and bodily autonomy - how about we address these issues and leave folks alone."
"@LoganMcCree777 @petermurphyuk1 @NationalNOW @CHSommers @PagliaQuotes Male normative is cultural. That’s the whole point of highlighting toxic masculinity, to remove things that are harmful to men, like suppressing their emotions, discouraging nurturing, encouraging aggression. To allow men to be men and not drive up suicide rates and violence"
@jbillinson This is toxic masculinity. The constant need to be “above” others be that in physical placement or social status. “I was born to be in it”
@danielleiat Toxic masculinity sounds like a horrible way for those men to live if the only emotions allowed are rivalry &amp; rage.
"@BlackSapphic true but i think what she was getting at is that men reduce women to their genitals or the way they express their gender in order to keep their fragile toxic masculinity safe.

basically: they change the definitions of what masculinity is supposed to be even if they contradict."

"if its toxic masculinity when a man does it but not when a woman does it, it was never toxic to begin with."
“Toxic masculinity” is less about being on the right side of history and more about an issue of the heart.
